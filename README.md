### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data.

### Description
This Python program loads, filters, displays data (on request) and computes statistics on bikeshare data

Please run the script in the terminal and follow the prompts.

I added a matplotlib visualization of busiest locations for chosen filters.
It will be produced in a separate window if your terminal allows GUI.
